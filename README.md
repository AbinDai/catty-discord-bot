# catty-discord-bot
A Discord bot that talks about animal. Written in discord.py by myself. Feel free to use this code:)

## Requirements
discord.py
Python 3.5+

## Installation
First, you have to download Python from it's website https://python.org/, then install it. Don't forget to check the `pip` while installing because we'll need it later.
Now, open your command prompt, type `pip install discord` to install the discord.py library. Wait until the installation done.

Create your bot account in the Discord Developer Portal here: https://discord.com/developers/applications/, and invite it to your server by accessing its Oauth2 invitation link.
Get the bot's token, open the bot.py file, and paste it on the `client.run("PASTE YOUR BOT'S TOKEN HERE")`.
Run the bot.py file, and there you go.
